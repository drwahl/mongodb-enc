# Puppet ENC Using Mongodb

This originally started as a fork of bcarpio/mongodb-enc, however it has turned in to a complete re-write.  I no longer consider this a fork, but a new project entirely.

## Documentation

Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/bcarpio/mongodb-enc/wiki). 


## Project Status

This project is still in **Alpha**. This means at any given time the code is under active development. There is still one big change coming where I change the mongodb schema. I currently don't like how I have the mongodb laid out. If you are using this code and would like to make feature requests please do so in the issue tracker.
