# Puppet ENC Using Mongodb

This originally started as a fork of bcarpio/mongodb-enc, however it has turned in to a complete re-write.  I no longer consider this a fork, but a new project entirely.

## Documentation

Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/bcarpio/mongodb-enc/wiki). 


## Project Status

This project is still in **Alpha**. This means at any given time the code is under active development. If you are using this code and would like to make feature requests please do so in the issue tracker.
